I graduated with an MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech

I graduated with a GPA of 4.0/4.0

At Georgia Tech I worked under Prof Srijan Kumar in the [CLAWS Lab](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/) as a part of my Special Problems in the Fall of 2022

I worked on understanding behaviours and motivations by subjects that choose to Counter Misinformation online
