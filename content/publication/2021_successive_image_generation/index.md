abstract: "Through various examples in history such as the early manâ€™s carving on caves, dependence on diagrammatic representations, the immense popularity of comic books we have seen that vision has a higher reach in communication than written words. In this paper, we analyse and propose a new task of transfer of information from text to image synthesis. Through this paper we aim to generate a story from a single sentence and convert our generated story into a sequence of images. We plan to use state of the art technology to implement this task. With the advent of Generative Adversarial Networks text to image synthesis have found a new awakening. We plan to take this task a step further, in order to automate the entire process. Our system generates a multi-lined story given a single sentence using a deep neural network. This story is then fed into our networks of multiple stage GANs inorder to produce a photorealistic image sequence."
