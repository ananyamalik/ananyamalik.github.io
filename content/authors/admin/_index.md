**About me**

I am currently working at [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/) as an SDE. I was a student researcher at Georgia Institute of Technology affiliated to the [CLAWS Lab](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/).In 2022 I graduated with an MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. 

**Research Interests**

My research broadly lies in using AI for Social Good. I want to analyse online conversations using multimodal models to predict and identify patterns that lead to disruptions such as the spread of misinformation and hate speech on social media. I then want to devise methodologies to recognise the biases in AI systems and quantify their impact on human behaviour, especially when these models are integrated with the systems that we use regularly. Finally, I want to apply these AI systems, to improve interactions, and to help users build online conversations that are less biased, more informative, and engaging, thus reducing the spread of misinformation and toxicity.

I sometimes post my outdoorish adventures on [@anansaidya](https://www.instagram.com/anansaidya/?hl=en) as I explore the Pacific North West! If you are in the Seattle Area, do reach out!
