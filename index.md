## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="ananya_profile.jpg">

Hi! I am a first year CS PhD student at [Khoury College of Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern University in Boston. I am advised by Prof [Mai ElSherief](https://www.maielsherief.com/). Before starting my PhD, I was a Software Engineer with the [Selection Monitoring and Catalog Systems](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/e-commerce-foundation/ascs) organization at Amazon in Seattle. Prior to that I was an MSCS student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). At Georgia Tech, I was advised by Prof [Srijan Kumar](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/) in the CLAWS Lab. I also dabble as a Research mentor with [SimPPL](https://simppl.org/).


## Research Interest

I am interested in understanding, evaluating and aligning AI for downstream and social good applications. This interest, primarily based in NLP applications, can be broadly classified into the following categories: 

1. Value Based Alignment  :

What started of as evaluating how models interpret and adapt to different personas of [gender and race](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14788), also evolved into understanding how they impact different downstream tasks like [hate speech detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20490) [Oral Presentation: SafeGenAI @ NeurIPS 2024]. My current work focusses on evaluating models on a value based axis using tasks such as emotional intelligence [In submission at COLM 2025]

Methadologically, using Value Based Alignment as a proposition, I am also interested to answer questions on how we can inject the user's persona to LLMs. One of the methods that I have focussed is on using dialects as a method of cultral identity. 

2. Understanding and Analyzing for Social Good Applications: 

I am interested in leveraging AI capabilities for understanding how communities --  specifically those cultivated online function. I have worked in understanding how misinformation can be countered using field studies on Twitter (now X). I have analysed [hate speech categories and reasoning](https://ananyamalikk.substack.com/p/intent-to-hate) and worked on a report classifying [dog whistles on social media](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hYIJjy92jo9VgBmfIY3AZTr-KUbr0dTa/view).
