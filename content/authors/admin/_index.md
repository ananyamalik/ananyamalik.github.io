**About me**

I am a student researcher at Georgia Institute of Technology affiliated to the [CLAWS Lab](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~srijan/). In 2022 I graduated with an MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech , and I will soon be working at [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/) as an Software Development Engineer.

**Research Interests**

My research interests lie in the intersection of HCI and NLP. I wish to study online conversations and social structure from the lens of both large scale inferences as well as behavioural changes. 

Currently I am involved in projects studying misinformation, specifically understanding behaviours of those who counter misinformation. 

<!-- **Future**

I am applying to Fall 2024 PhD programs this admission cycle. -->
